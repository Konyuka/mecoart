                    <h2 class="text-primary">Cooking Equipment</h2>
                    <p>
                        Cooking equipment is the cornerstone of any commercial kitchen. When choosing cooking equipment for your restaurant, be sure to think about what pieces of equipment you're going to be using most often. While smaller pieces of equipment may be less expensive, they may not meet your capacity needs if you're going to be using them regularly, costing your business more in the long run.
                        <br>
                        Here's our list of essential cooking equipment for restaurants:
                    </p>
                    <ul class="highlights">
                    <li class="icon-check"><strong>Oven:</strong> This versatile piece of equipment can be used for baking, roasting, braising, and much more. As a result, an oven (or multiple ovens, depending on your business) is essential.</li>
                    <li class="icon-check"><strong>Range:</strong> You can choose either electric or gas ranges, depending on your preferences and kitchen setup. </li>
                    <li class="icon-check"><strong>Deep Fryer:</strong> While deep fryers are ideal for making french fries, chicken tenders, and other customer favorites, you can use them for frying up a variety of foods.</li>
                    <li class="icon-check"><strong>Grill:</strong> Charbroilers and other grills impart a smoky and charred flavor that's perfect for many different recipes. </li>
                    <li class="icon-check"><strong>Griddles:</strong> Similar to grills but with a flat metallic surface, griddles are a mainstay in diners and can be used for a variety of different cooking methods.</li>
                    <li class="icon-check"><strong>Holding Equipment:</strong> Holding cabinets keep your food at a specific temperature, which makes them ideal for holding food until it's ready to serve or proofing breads before baking.</li>
                    <li class="icon-check"><strong>Salamander or Broiler:</strong> These products are perfect for finishing dishes, toasting bread, or melting cheese. Also, salamanders have high enough heat output to broil salmon or cook foods.</li>
                    <li class="icon-check"><strong>Toaster:</strong> If your restaurant is going to be open for breakfast, a commercial toaster is a must for your bread and bagels.</li>
                    <li class="icon-check"><strong>Coffee Brewer:</strong> Coffee is a popular beverage, and it's a great addition to your beverage service, even if you're not opening a cafe or bakery.</li>

                    </ul>

                    <h2 class="text-primary">Refrigeration Equipment</h2>
                    <p>
                        There are many different styles of refrigeration equipment, and the style you choose will depend on your type of restaurant and your specific refrigeration needs. But, here are some examples that a standard restaurant might choose: <br>
                    </p>
                    <ul class="highlights">
                    <li class="icon-check"><strong>Refrigerator:</strong> Some common types of refrigerators include walk-in coolers, <strong>reach-in fridges</strong>, pass-through options, or prep fridges. It is likely that your restaurant will require a combination of different types.</li>
                    <li class="icon-check"><strong>Freezer:</strong> Like refrigerators, freezers come in various sizes and styles to suit your needs and food capacities. </li>
                    <li class="icon-check"><strong>Ice Machine:</strong> Ice machines are an essential component for beverage service at any restaurant. Additionally, cafes, bars, and grocery stores may use ice to make smoothies or blended cocktails. </li>
                    <li class="icon-check"><strong>Beverage Dispensers</strong> Some establishments like fast food and fast casual restaurants may have self service beverage dispensers, while others may have them at wait stations. When choosing a dispenser, think of how many soft drink options you want to serve and which brand of soda you're going to choose.</li>
                    </ul>  
                    
                    <h2 class="text-primary">Storage Equipment</h2>
                    <p>In addition to refrigeration, every restaurant will need storage equipment for ingredients as well as smallwares and equipment. Here are some standard pieces of storage equipment you'll find in most restaurants: <br></p>
                    <ul class="highlights">
                    <li class="icon-check"><strong>Shelving:</strong> You can use shelving in your walk-in cooler or freezer for storing different foods. You can also use shelving for storing pots, pans, dinnerware, dry ingredients, and more. Shelving comes in a variety of sizes and configurations, allowing you to customize your shelving for your space. </li>
                    <li class="icon-check"><strong>Bussing and Utility Carts:</strong> Bussing and utility carts are essential to have in the kitchen due to their utility. You can use them in the front-of-house area for bussing tables or in the back-of-house area for moving heavy equipment or ingredients.</li>
                    <li class="icon-check"><strong>Sheet Pan Racks:</strong> Sheet pan racks are designed for storing and transporting foods, but you can also use them for holding and proofing breads. Sheet pan racks are designed to be tall rather than wide, so they have a small footprint, which is ideal for cramped kitchens.</li>
                    <li class="icon-check"><strong>Food Storage Containers:</strong> Food storage containers are the perfect multi-purpose tools. You can use them to store prepped ingredients, mix up sauces and stocks, or hold dry items like pasta or rice. Best of all, many food storage containers come with colored lids or markings, so you can color code them for easy organization.</li>
                    <li class="icon-check"><strong>Drying Racks:</strong> Drying racks provide a place to not only store your equipment, but to also air dry it. You can use drying racks for drying dinnerware, glassware, cookware, cutting boards, utensils, and much more.</li>
                    <li class="icon-check"><strong>Dunnage Racks:</strong> Dunnage racks are similar to drying racks in that they're used for drying equipment, but dunnage racks are usually only a few inches off of the ground. You can use them for heavy items, such canned goods, bags of rice, or large pieces of equipment.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2 class="text-primary">Food Prep Equipment</h2>

                    <li class="icon-check"><strong>Spice Grinders:</strong> While using pre-ground spices is economical, freshly ground spices and herbs have a unique flavor that can give your recipes more depth of flavor.</li>
